        The BMW X3 is a compact luxury crossover SUV manufactured by German automaker BMW since 2003. Based on the BMW 3 Series platform, and now in its third generation, BMW markets the crossover as a Sports Activity Vehicle, the company's proprietary descriptor for its X-line of vehicles. The first generation X3 was designed by BMW in conjunction with Magna Steyr of Graz, Austria—who also manufactured all X3s under contract to BMW. BMW manufactures the second generation X3 at their Spartanburg plant in South Carolina, United States. The third generation of the BMW X3 is also manufactured at BMW South Africa's Rosslyn plant, a facility that recently underwent a major upgrade to prepare for the X3 production. About 76,000 units will be manufactured there annually.

    <h1> BMW X5  </h1>
    <br>
    <img class="center2" src="../images/suv/x5.jpg" alt="BMW X4">
      <p> 
        The X5 made its debut in 1999. It was BMW's first SUV and it also featured all-wheel drive and was available with either manual or automatic transmission. In 2006, the second generation X5 was launched, known internally as the E70, featuring the torque-split capable xDrive all-wheel drive system mated to an automatic transmission, and in 2009 the X5 M performance variant was released as a 2010 model.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        BMW branded the X5 as a Sport Activity Vehicle (SAV) rather than an SUV, to emphasize its on-road ability despite its size. Like the Lexus RX 300, the X5 heralded the shift from light truck-based body-on-frame SUVs to crossovers underpinned by unibody car platforms that would come to fruition in the late 2000s. Among German luxury automakers, while the Mercedes-Benz M-Class had beaten the X5 to the market by a year, the X5 was the first to use a unibody chassis whereas the M-Class used a light truck platform until its second generation. While the Lexus RX is based on the Toyota Camry mass market sedan, the X5 shares its underpinnings with the BMW 5 Series performance luxury sedan.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        X5s are manufactured in Greer, South Carolina at the Spartanburg BMW plant and modified for armoured, security versions in Mexico at the BMW de México Toluca plant. Since July 2009, some assembly operations are also performed in Kaliningrad, Russia by Avtotor. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Starting with the X5, BMW's "SAV" series has since expanded with derivatives of other BMW number-series models, first in 2003 with the BMW X3 compact luxury crossover, and then in 2008 with the BMW X6 midsize coupe luxury crossover which shares its platform with the X5.

It combines the attributes of an SUV (high ground clearance, all-wheel drive and all-weather ability, large wheels and tires) with the stance of a coupé (styling featuring a sloping roof). It was based on the previous generation BMW 5 and 6 Series. E71 development began in 2003 under Peter Tuennermann, after start of E70 X5 development in 2001.
