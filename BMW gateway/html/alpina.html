        Alpina Burkard Bovensiepen GmbH & Co. KG is an automobile manufacturing company based in Buchloe, in the Ostallgäu district of Bavaria, Germany that develops and sells high-performance versions of BMW cars.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Alpina works closely with BMW and their processes are integrated into BMW's production lines, thus Alpina is recognized by the German Ministry of Transport as an automobile manufacturer, in contrast to other performance specialists which are aftermarket tuners. For instance, the Alpina B7 is produced at the same assembly line in Dingolfing, Germany (BMW Plant Dingolfing), as BMW's own 7 Series. The B7's twin-turbo 4.4-litre V8 is assembled by hand at Alpina's facility in Buchloe, Germany, before being shipped to BMW for installation, and the assembled vehicle is then sent back to Alpina for finishing touches.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
          The firm was founded in 1965 by Burkard Bovensiepen, a member of the Bovensiepen family of industrialists.

      <h1> F30 Alpina B3 Bi-Turbo  </h1>
      <br>
      <img class="center2" src="../images/alpina/b3.jpg" alt="Alpina B3">
        <p>
          The F30 Alpina B3 Bi-Turbo was in production since March 2013. It is based on the BMW F30 335i with a bi-turbocharged 3.0 liter six-cylinder. The 301 kW (404 hp; 409 PS) engine with 600 N⋅m (443 lb⋅ft) of torque accelerates the B3 from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.0 seconds. The top speed is 305 km/h (190 mph). The B3 Biturbo is available as a sedan or touring, both can be combined with xDrive four-wheel drive. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Alpina modified the exterior with front and rear spoilers and a 4-exit exhaust system.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          In March 2017, Alpina revised the engine of the B3, It now produces 324 kW (434 hp; 441 PS).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          A new model based on the G20 3 Series replaced the F30 model.

      <h1> Alpina B5 Bi-Turbo  </h1>
      <br>
      <img class="center2" src="../images/alpina/B52.jpg" alt="Alpina B5">
        <p>
          The Alpina B5 was introduced at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show in all-wheel drive only Saloon and Touring variants. The B5 features a 4.4-litre N63M30 V8 engine that generates a maximum power output of 447 kW (599 hp; 608 PS) and 800 N⋅m (590 lb⋅ft) of torque. Based on the N63B44O2 V8, it has uprated pistons,[25] new twin-scroll Garrett turbochargers[26] and new spark plugs by NGK. The B5 can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) 3.5 seconds with a top speed of 330 km/h (205 mph), making it the fastest estate car currently in production.

      <h1> Alpina B7  </h1>
      <br>
      <img class="center2" src="../images/alpina/B7.jpg" alt="Alpina B7">
        <p>
            The Alpina B7 is one of the two Alpina cars offered in the USA and Canada, the other one being the Alpina B6.[34] The B7 is produced at the same assembly line in Dingolfing, Germany, along with BMW's own 7 Series.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            BMW permitted Alpina to produce a high-performance version of its flagship 7 Series, however they did not want it to be a high-revving, BMW M version (which would have been known as a "BMW M7" under the current nomenclature). It has also been suggested that there was no market for an M7 that would have featured the BMW M's trademark high-rev engine and twin-clutch automated manual transmission, and most customers who desired a performance option in the 7 Series would have gone for the V12-engined BMW 760Li.
