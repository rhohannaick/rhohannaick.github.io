            The BMW 1 Series is a range of subcompact executive cars (C-segment) manufactured by BMW since 2004. It is the successor to the BMW 3 Series Compact and is currently in its third generation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The first generation was produced in hatchback, coupe and convertible body styles. Since the second generation (introduced in 2013), the coupé and convertible models have been marketed as the 2 Series, therefore the 1 Series range no longer includes these body styles. A sedan model became available for the Chinese market in 2017.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The 1 Series is BMW's entry level of model range. Unusually for a small car, the 1 Series range is mostly rear-wheel drive, (except for the F52 sedan, which is front-wheel drive) with optional all-wheel drive being available on some models.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            An M version was produced for the first generation: the BMW 1 Series M Coupe, which was succeeded by the BMW M2.

          The BMW 2 Series is a subcompact executive car (C-segment) produced by BMW. The 2 Series has several different body styles. It is available as a compact coupé that replaced the 1 Series coupé, or as a convertible model that replaces the 1 Series convertible in the BMW lineup. There is also a new compact MPV body style, which BMW refers to as an Active Tourer. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The 2 Series Active Tourer mechanicals are unrelated to the coupé and convertible models'. While it shares the 2 Series name, it is built on a totally different front wheel drive platform that is shared with the third generation MINI Cooper, dubbed UKL2. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The 2 Series currently competes with new models from Audi and Mercedes-Benz, the A3 Sedan and the CLA Class. In June 2015, BMW also released a seven seater 2 Series Gran Tourer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            BMW revealed a Gran Coupé variant in October 2019 and is available with either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive

        <br>
        <p>
          The BMW 3 Series is a compact executive car manufactured by the German automaker BMW since May 1975. It is the successor to the 02 Series and has been produced in seven different generations.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The first generation of the 3 Series was only available as a 2-door sedan (saloon), however the model range has since expanded to include a 4-door sedan, 2-door convertible, 2-door coupé, 5-door station wagon, 5-door hatchback ("Gran Turismo") and 3-door hatchback body styles. Since 2013, the coupé and convertible models have been marketed as the 4 Series, therefore the 3 Series range no longer includes these body styles. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The 3 Series is BMW's best-selling model, accounting for around 30% of the BMW brand's annual total sales (excluding motorbikes). The BMW 3 Series has won numerous awards throughout its history. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The M version of the 3 series, M3, debuted with the E30 M3 in 1986.

          The BMW 4 Series is a range of coupé, convertible and fastback models manufactured by the German automaker BMW since 2013. It was unveiled at the North American International Auto Show in January 2013 in Detroit.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The 4 Series was created when BMW spun off the 3 Series 2-door models (coupé and convertible) into a separate series. In 2014, the "4 Series Gran Coupé" 4-door fastback body style was added to the range.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            BMW unveiled the Concept 4 at the 2019 Frankfurt Auto Show, which was 85 percent representative of the production version, and also form the basis of the all-electric BMW i4. Stylistically, the front is dominated by a large new interpretation of the kidney grille, featuring a more vertical design to distance it from the G20 3 Series

        <br>
        <p>
          The BMW 5 Series is an executive car manufactured by BMW since 1972. It is the successor to the New Class Sedans and is currently in its seventh generation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Initially, the 5 Series was only available in a sedan body style. The wagon/estate body style (called "Touring") was added in 1991 and the 5-door fastback (called "Gran Turismo") was produced from 2009 to 2017. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The first generation of 5 Series was powered by naturally aspirated four-cylinder and six-cylinder petrol engines. Following generations have been powered by four-cylinder, six-cylinder, V8 and V10 engines that are either naturally aspirated or turbocharged. Since 1982, diesel engines have been included in the 5 Series range. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The 5 Series is BMW's second best-selling model after the 3 Series. On January 29, 2008, the 5 millionth 5 Series was manufactured, a 530d sedan in Carbon Black Metallic.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> 
            BMW's three-digit model naming convention began with the first 5 Series, thus the 5 Series was BMW's first model line to use "Series" in the name.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
           Since the E28, all generations of 5 Series have included an "M" model, called the BMW M5.

        <br>
        <p>
          The BMW 6 Series is a range of grand tourers produced by BMW since 1976. It is the successor to the E9 Coupé and is currently in its fourth generation. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The first generation BMW E24 6 Series was available solely as a two-door coupé and produced from 1976 to 1989, then it was supplanted by the BMW 8 Series (E31) although the latter had a substantially higher price and performance. When the 6 Series nameplate was revived in 2004 for the second generation, the BMW E63/E64 6 Series, the coupé was joined by a convertible body style. The third generation F06/F12/F13 6 Series debuted in 2011 as a coupé and convertible, and added a four-door coupé body style (known as the Gran Coupé) in 2012. When the F06/F12/F13 6 Series ended production, the "Gran Coupé"/coupé/convertible models have been shifted into the more upmarket BMW 8 Series (G15) nameplate. The fourth generation 6 Series, the G32 6 Series, debuted in mid-2017 and is offered only as a fastback body style to complement the BMW 5 Series (G30) sedan/wagon. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The first generation 6 Series was derived from the BMW E23 7 Series, and was powered by a range of naturally aspirated inline-six gasoline engines. Following generations have been powered by inline-four, V8, and V10 engines with both natural aspiration and turbocharging. Since 2008, diesel engines have been included in the 6 Series range, with four-wheel drive models on offer since 2012.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Since the first generation BMW E24 6 Series in 1983, all models have been offered with a high-performance M variant.

          The BMW 7 Series is a full-size luxury sedan produced by the German automaker BMW since 1977. It is the successor to the BMW E3 "New Six" sedan and is currently in its sixth generation
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The 7 Series is BMW's flagship car and is only available in a saloon bodystyle (including long wheelbase and limousine models). It traditionally introduces technologies and exterior design themes before they trickle down to other models in BMW's lineup.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The first generation of the 7 Series was powered by straight-6 petrol engines, and following generations have been powered by inline-4, straight-6, V8 and V12 engines with both natural aspiration and turbocharging. Since 1995, diesel engines have been optional in the 7 Series. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Unlike the 3 Series and 5 Series saloons, BMW has not produced a M model for the 7 Series (i.e. an "M7"). However, in 2014 an "M Performance" option became available for the 7 Series.

        <br>
        <p>
            The 8 Series was introduced in 1990 under the E31 model code and was only available as a two-door coupé. It is powered by a range of naturally aspirated V8 and V12 petrol engines. The E31 started production just as E24 6 Series production ended, however it is not considered a direct successor. It was later discontinued in 1999 due to poor sales.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The model range was later reintroduced in 2018 with the second generation, G15 8 Series. It is expected to launch in coupé (G15), convertible (G14), and four-door Gran Coupé (G16) body styles, as the successor to the F06/F12/F13 6 Series lineup. The G15 8 Series introduces an inline-six diesel engine, and a high-performance M8 model is also expected to be launched in the future.

          The BMW i3 is a B-class, high-roof hatchback manufactured and marketed by BMW with an electric powertrain using rear wheel drive via a single-speed transmission and an underfloor Li-ion battery pack and an optional range-extending gasoline engine. The i3 was BMW's first mass-produced zero emissions vehicle and was launched as part of BMW's electric vehicle BMW i sub-brand.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Styled by Richard Kim, the i3 uses a single five-door configuration with bodywork consisting of a passenger module of high strength, ultra-lightweight CFRP (carbon fiber reinforced plastic) glued to a lower aluminium module holding the chassis, battery, drive system and powertrain. The bodywork features two smaller clamshell rear-hinged rear doors. The i3 debuted as a concept at the 2011 International Motor Show Germany, and production began in July 2013 in Leipzig, Germany. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The i3 ranked third among all-electric cars sold worldwide from 2014 to 2016. Global sales since inception totaled more than 133,000 units through the end of 2018. The U.S. is its best-selling market with over 37,000 units sold through 2018.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The BMW i3 has won two World Car of the Year Awards, selected as 2014 World Green Car of the Year and also as 2014 World Car Design of the Year.

        <p>
          The BMW i8 is a plug-in hybrid sports car developed by BMW. The i8 is part of BMW's electric fleet "Project i" being marketed as a new sub-brand, BMW i. The 2015 model year BMW i8 has a 7.1 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that delivers an all-electric range of 37 km (23 mi) under the New European Driving Cycle. Under the United States Environmental Protection Agency cycle, the range in EV mode is 24 km (15 mi) with a small amount of gasoline consumption. Its design is heavily influenced by the BMW M1 Homage concept car, which in turn pays homage to BMW's last production mid-engined sports car prior to the i8: the BMW M1. BMW will cease the production of the BMW i8 in April 2020
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The BMW i8 accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.4 seconds and has an electronic limited top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph). The BMW i8 has a fuel efficiency of 2.1 L/100 km (134.5 mpg‑imp; 112.0 mpg‑US) under the NEDC test with carbon emissions of 49 g/km. The EPA rated the i8 combined fuel economy at 76 MPGe (3.1 L gasoline equivalent/100 km; 91 mpg-imp gasoline equivalent) and 29 miles per gallon (6.7L/100 km) when running in pure gasoline mode (after the battery is drained empty). 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The initial turbodiesel concept car was unveiled at the 2009 International Motor Show Germany. The production version of the BMW i8 was unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show. The i8 was released in Germany in June 2014. Deliveries to retail customers in the U.S. began in August 2014. By early November 2016 global sales since mid-2014 totaled more than 10,000 BMW i8s, making the i8 the world's top selling plug-in electrified sports car. The top selling markets are the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, China and Canada.
